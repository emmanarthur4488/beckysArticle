        <h2 class="article_title">What is criticism?</h2>
        <p class="article content">
            Criticism according to the dictionary is the expression of disapproval of someone or something on the basis of perceived faults or mistakes. <br><br>
            <b>Two main types of criticism:</b> <br><br>
            <b>Constructive criticism :</b> <br><br>
            Constructive criticism is a form of feedback that focuses on delivering critique and negative feedback constructively and positively to improve performance or behavior. 
            Constructive criticism is actionable, clear, and beneficial to the recipient. <br> <br>
            <b>Destructive Criticism :</b> <br> <br>
            Destructive criticism is a type of criticism that's intended to harm, undermine, or even destroy someone's creation, reputation, or self-esteem. 
            It's when someone chews you out, mercilessly rips apart your idea, or publicly denigrates your abilities.
            Take the constructive criticism and ignore the destructive. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="article_title">POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE?</h2>
        <p class="article content">
            <b>Oh, you're talented.</b> <br><br>
            I heard this today from someone. 
            She was astounded when she saw me sewing a dress and asked how I could create such a lovely clothing. 
            At last, she had to say that. I told her, "Thank you, ma," as I gave her a glance. 
            However, I felt ecstatic within. I mean, this kind of praise and even the term "talent" are all possible. 
            I decided to keep trying my hardest no matter what because of that. 
            It wasn't until she remarked that I realized how gorgeous the dress I was constructing was.
            It occurred to me then that she could have put me off if she had called the clothing ugly or said something hurtful. 
            This is my way of telling you to be careful with the words you choose. 
            You will either influence people in a positive or negative way with your words. 
            See how you interact with others. Never belittle someone, no matter what; your words have the power to either uplift or depress someone. 
            Be one of those who uplifts others rather than tears them down.

        <h2 class="article_title">All Villains Are Not Evil‚ÄºÔ∏è</h2>
        <p class="article content">
            There is something called the law of cause and effect. 
            Now, this is a very important C when it comes to story writing. 
            Why? 
            People don't just carry out actions, there is always a reason behind it. 
            Nobody will just wake up one morning and decide to be intentional with his/her life without a reason. Probably, your friends underrate you because of your nonchalant lifestyle and so you decided to be serious with your life.
            There has to be a cause. 
            This is one reason you can't label a bad guy all evil. 
            Personal experience has a way of shaping one's belief system. 
            The upbringing of a character could be the reason why he/she is a serial killer. 
            Let us take Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights as our case study. He was picked off the streets by Mr. Earnshaw, but after his benefactor's death, he was maltreated by the heir. His education stopped and worse still, his lover, Catherine said she couldn't marry him because of his poor status. 
            He flees but returns and kicks off his revenge plan. 
            Did you notice the cause and effect? 
            No one can be good or bad without a valid reason. Something has to lead to an action, either good or bad. 
            Dear Story Writer,
            Do well to implement cause and effect in your story. 
            Misan loves you. ‚ù§Ô∏è <br> <br>
            <b>CHAPTER TWO</b> <br> <br>
            Jane ran to the gate to open but she discovered it has been locked. She felt she was going to pee on her body. How come? She asked herself. She wished she could just disappear that very moment.
            She turned to look at the voice, but she couldn't figure out who the person was. 
            He was tall and huge, dressed in an all black outfit covering all his body, his face was also covered with a mask.
            "Who the hell are you?" Jane asked scared.
            "You answer my question first, young lady." The man responded.
            "You are in my father's house and you're asking foolish questions." 
            "Hey, Mr, don't you ever stand in my way again" Jane said while turning back to the gate.
            "And how do you think I got the access to your father's house? Yes, you might be his daughter, but we have known him long enough before you came into existence. Now young woman, I don't want to loose it on you, turn around right now!" The man said ordering her.
            Before she could turn, two hefty hands carried and blindfolded her face. 
            "Please, I'm sorry, forgive me." She said.
            "Shut your mouth, you stubborn, arrogant human." One of the men said.
            "Somebody please help me, help me." She shouted.
            "Unfortunately, you already gave sleeping pills to those that could help you, so my dear, you are on your own." Another said as they all laugh mischievously. 
            "You foolish men, how did you know?" Jane asked surprised.
            "One more word from you and you'll be a dead person." Their boss said.
            She was carried out of the building while one of the men threw her into the vehicle. She only knew she was in a car but didn't know where they were heading to.
            The car pulled up at a deserted area as one of the men dragged her out.
            "Move!" He ordered as he hit her with his hands.
            He dragged her to a room and she was made to sit on a chair. The man tied both her hands and legs. 
            He left the room and locked the door. She tried to free herself but could not.
            "If my father should lay his hands on them, they'll be nothing but dead men."  She assured herself.
            The door to the room was opened as she heard the sound of door and footsteps. 
            "What's your phone password?" The man asked removing the covering on her mouth.
            "You can't have access to my phone." She said.
            "Are you mad?" The man inquired as he smacked her across her face.
            "Now tell me!" He ordered while shouting.
            "25639." She responded frightened.
            "Good girl."
            *************************
            Jane already dozed off when she heard the door of the room opening.
            "Wow! So this bastard is sleeping, Could you imagine, boss? She is very rude and arrogant, she's not trained well."
            "Aragon, that's none of your business, don't lose focus, we have our target."
            "That voice sounds familiar." Jane thought within her.
            "Have you given her anything to eat?"
            "No, sir."
            "I don't want her to starve, go get something for her."
            "Alright, sir."
            "Hi, my pretty babygirl." The man said as he moved closer to her.
            Jane knows the voice already. 
            "There is no other person that calls me babygirl except my...

            ‚ÄúChoose‚Äù vs. ‚Äúchose‚Äù: <br> What‚Äôs the difference?</h2>
        <p class="article content">
            As mentioned above, ‚Äúchoose‚Äù and ‚Äúchose‚Äù are two versions of the same verb‚Äî‚Äúchoose‚Äù is present tense‚Äù and ‚Äúchose‚Äù is past tense. <br>
            The verb ‚Äúchoose‚Äù means to pick out or select something from multiple options. ‚ÄúChose‚Äù is the past tense of ‚Äúchoose,‚Äù which means that it has the same meaning, but it indicates that the action occurred in the past rather than the present. <br>
            The key to knowing when to write the word ‚Äúchoose‚Äù rather than ‚Äúchose‚Äù is understanding the tense in which you‚Äôre writing. <br> 
            Is the action occurring now? Then select ‚Äúchoose.‚Äù Has the action already occurred? Then select ‚Äúchose.‚Äù <br>
            Examples of when to use ‚Äúchoose‚Äù <br>
            -You need to choose a lipstick to wear. <br>\
            -She chooses the blue car. <br>
            -I hope they choose me as a candidate. <br>
            -We need to choose a vacation destination. <br>
            ‚ÄúChoose‚Äù can also be used to describe the future. Use ‚Äúchoose‚Äù after an auxiliary verb like ‚Äúgo‚Äù or ‚Äúwill‚Äù to form the future tense: <br>
            -He will choose a college major next year. <br>
            -I‚Äôm going to choose what to order after seeing the menu. <br>
            Examples of when to use ‚Äúchose‚Äù <br>
            -We chose to go to Thailand on vacation. <br>
            -She chose to study physics last semester. <br>
            -I chose to skip my date because I wasn‚Äôt feeling well. <br>
            -They chose the winner of the contest. <br>
            To get familiar with using ‚Äúchoose‚Äù versus ‚Äúchose‚Äù in your own writing, try writing a few examples yourself. With a little practice, you‚Äôll be an expert on ‚Äúchoose‚Äù versus ‚Äúchose‚Äù in no time. <br>
            I'm hoping that you're clear now and won't use "chose" instead of "choose" again.
